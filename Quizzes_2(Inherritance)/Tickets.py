# Murovanyi Andrey.KNIT16-A
# Issue:
# Write a program for selling tickets to IT-events. Each ticket has a unique
# number and a price. There are four types of tickets: regular ticket,
# advance ticket (purchased 60 or more days before the event),
# late ticket (purchased fewer than 10 days
# before the event) and student ticket.
# Additional information:
# * advance ticket - discount 40% of the regular ticket price;
# * student ticket - discount 50% of the regular ticket price;
# * late ticket - additional 10% to the regular ticket price.
# All tickets must have the following properties:
# * the ability to construct a ticket by number;
# * the ability to ask for a ticketâ€™s price;
# * the ability to print a ticket as a String.

# Let's suppose, that the IT-event will be today.
